//? Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and profit if the job is finished before the deadline. It is also given that every job takes a single unit of time, so the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. Maximize the total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.
// The greedy approach will be to sort according to the maximum profit and choose that first

package main

func main() {
	jobs := [][]int{{4, 20}, {1, 10}, {1, 40}, {1, 30}} // 2, 0
